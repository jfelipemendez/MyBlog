                    <h3>2021/01/28</h3>
                    <p>Welcome to my first blog post!<br>
                        <br>
                       Today I spent an hour doing free code camp, another doing some self teaching and 
                       applying what i learnt making this blog! In total, I have spent 2 hours working on this
                       blog. It does not seem like much but I have big plans for this. My goal is to apply what I learn
                       to this blog everyday. I am very excited to apply javascript to this blog and make it more interactive! 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="blog-post">
                    <h3>2021/01/29</h3>
                    <p>3/100 #100daysofcoding<br>
                        <br>
                       Today I completed the CSS portion of free code camp! I found that, even though it seems repetive going back
                       through the basics is important. My goal is to make this a full functional blog, with both a frontend and backend.
                       Currently I am writing these post directly into my html code using using the paragraph tags lol!
                       <br>
                       <br>
                       I know for a fact there is an easier way of doing this but i just have not figrued it out yet.
                       There is any idea i have but unfortunatly been able to figrue out how to apply it. It's okay 
                       though, it would not be much of a journey if I already knew everything.
                       <br>
                       <br> 
                       In the links to the right, you will find the langauges i am learning and inside of them
                       you will find examples of coding and or actual pictures of the code for this blog! That way
                       people can see the evolution of not only this site but my skills! It will be coming soon!

                        <br>
                       After a long day of watching videos on youtube, just learning the basics of
                       Git and github. I am very happy that i am able to use git to create files and
                       also add, remove, commit and push to main in my git hub repository!<br>
                       <br>
                       During the second half of the day, I went on free code camp and started chipping
                       away at the extremely long "Applied visual design" section of the certificate. Learnt about positoning
                       in css and colors. That is why I have started messing around with the colors of this
                       blog.
